# CookieCutter for Fedora Messaging schemas

This is a [CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template directory for
[Fedora Messaging message schemas](https://fedora-messaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messages.html).

Use it with:
```
cookiecutter gh:fedora-infra/cookiecutter-message-schemas
